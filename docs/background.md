Background

Modern buildings rely on accurate occupancy information to optimize HVAC systems, reduce energy usage, and improve comfort. Traditional methods often rely on cameras or specialized hardware, which can be expensive and raise privacy concerns. As IoT sensors become more common, interest has grown in using passive data sources such as temperature, sound, or CO₂ to infer human presence.

This project investigates whether these IoT signals can reliably estimate room occupancy. By applying data mining and machine learning methods in Python, we explore sensor correlations, temporal patterns, and predictive relationships across multiple environmental indicators.
