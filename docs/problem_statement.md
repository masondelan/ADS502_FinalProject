Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to predict room occupancy using environmental sensor data. We analyze multiple types of IoT measurements—temperature, sound, light, CO₂, and PIR motion—to build predictive models that determine how many people are in the room at any moment. The model will support energy-efficient building automation by offering a non-invasive, sensor-based alternative to traditional occupancy detection systems.
