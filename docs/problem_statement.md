Problem Statement

This project focuses on predicting room occupancy using environmental IoT sensor data. Instead of estimating the exact number of people present, the objective is to classify whether a room is occupied or unoccupied. This approach is more suitable for the dataset, which contains a much larger proportion of unoccupied readings compared to occupied ones.
